                <p>
                    When uploading text, you have two options. But first of all, you go to <a href="/upload">/upload</a> to upload text.
                    Though, back to your options.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first one is automatic, which is the default option.
                    This option is the slowest, as I check each word. Additionally, this does not work if you want spanish phrases to be translated. Automatic only does it by each word.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second one is custom chosen. With this mode you get to tell me what words are in spanish, which lets you seperate them by phrase/sentence if desired.
                    To activate this mode, simply add <code>!CUSTOM-CHOSEN</code> as the first line when uploading. Then, put squigily brackets around each phrase. For example: <code>{¿Cómo estás?}</code>. When you click on it, it will say <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3214/read/gsctpirafv">How are you?</a> instead of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3214/read/vmlwigsbqcvmw"><code>como</code> saying how, and estás saying <code>to be</code></a>.
